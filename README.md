# Description
This is a repository for CSCE 548 Spring 2026. It is the repo for 
The semester-long project I will be tasked with creating and examining to see if AI can create secure software. It is using MySQL for database storage and is coded in Java (Springboot w/ Maven) for the backend. The front end is currently a single Java file but will be converted to a small React set up by the end of Project 3.

*** Note that I do not have my DB hosted but have included the schema and example clients in their own .sql files. These can be located in "CSCE548/clientapp/src/main/java/com/example/sql/".
